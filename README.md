# Modular Arithmetic Animation

Small QBasic64 program to generate the type of modular arithmetic animations shown in Mathologer's [Times Tables, Mandelbrot and the Heart of Mathematics](/c/Users/steph/Projects/qbasic/animate-modular-arithmetic) YouTube video.

The first programming language I learned was QBasic as a 12 year old back in 1999 and it's been literal decades since I've written a QBasic program.  After learning on a modern QBasic implementation, I figured it would be cool to use it to create an animation that I really liked.

I've included the executable `modular_art.exe` that you can use to view the animation if you don't have QBasic64 set up on your system to compile the code in `modular_art.bas`.  This was compiled on Windows x86-64, so you'll probably have to recompile yourself if you're using a different architecture (and definitely have to recompile if using a different OS obvi).
